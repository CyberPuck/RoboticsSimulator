# RoboticsSimulator
Simulator for my 2016 Robotics class, please see LICENSE.txt for licensing.

## Framework
This project is written in Java, the UI is JavaFX.  Current SDK targeting is Java 1.7 (this is subject to change).
In order to use scene builder for rapid UI dev, I used the product here:  http://gluonhq.com/open-source/scene-builder/
